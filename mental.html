        <h1><strong>Raising awareness on mental health</strong></h1>
        <p>Mental health is a topic that needs more awareness. 
        It is not something that people talk about openly and it is considered to be a taboo subject.
         Mental health problems are not just an individual's problem, but they are also the society's problem.
          The stigma around mental health has been slowly fading away, 
          but there are still many misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding mental illness.<br> 
          One of the most common misconceptions is that people with mental illnesses are violent or dangerous. 
          This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims 
          of violence than perpetrators of violence.</p>
